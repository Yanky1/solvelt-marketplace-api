# Solvelt marketplace API

The buyer-side backend of the Solvelt marketplace: buyer accounts, catalog read model, cart, checkout (Stripe) and bookings.
It talks to the seller portal through the portal's signed internal API and outbox webhooks (see [docs/CONTRACT.md](docs/CONTRACT.md)).

## Stack
.NET 10, ASP.NET Core minimal APIs, EF Core. SQLite for dev and tests, PostgreSQL (Npgsql) in production.

## Run
```bash
dotnet run --project src/Solvelt.Marketplace.Api        # Development: SQLite file, fixed dev secrets
```
`ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development` is the default for `dotnet run`. `GET /health` answers `{"status":"ok"}`.

## Test
```bash
dotnet test                                               # real SQLite, one temp database per test factory
TEST_DB_PROVIDER=postgres \
TEST_POSTGRES_CONNECTION="Host=localhost;Username=postgres;Password=postgres;Database=postgres" \
  dotnet test                                             # the same tests against PostgreSQL (a fresh database per factory)
```
CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) restores, builds with warnings as errors, runs the tests on SQLite, and runs them again against a PostgreSQL service container.
It runs on pushes to `main`, `feat/**`, `fix/**` and on pull requests.

No secrets are stored in the repository.
